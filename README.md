### 💼 Experience & Projects

#### 👩‍💻 Technical Projects
- 🔍 **Fraud Detection System** – Built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions using classification algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost with feature engineering and data imbalance handling.
  
- 🌍 **Kiva Loans Analysis** – Analyzed real-world loan data from Kiva.org to understand global lending patterns, gender distribution, repayment behavior, and sector trends using data visualization and preprocessing techniques.
  
- 🧭 **Map Routing with Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – Implemented a C++ routing system using Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path between cities. Used adjacency lists, priority queues, and efficient graph traversal strategies.
  
- 🧱 **Home Decor Fantasy (Data Structures Project)** – Developed a creative C++ project simulating a fantasy home decoration system. Applied concepts like linked lists, stacks, queues, and tree structures to manage user interactions and items.
  
- 📊 **Loan Approval Prediction** – Created a machine learning pipeline to predict loan approval status using logistic regression and decision trees. Handled data cleaning, feature selection, and model evaluation.
  
- 💬 **Sentiment Analysis with NLP** – Designed a basic text classification project using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes to analyze sentiments in product reviews and predict positive/negative feedback.



#### 🎤 Events & Leadership
- 🧭 **Team Leader of the Info Desk Team** at **ASU Career Center**, leading a highly visible and responsive team responsible for assisting 4000+ attendees during Career Week and other high-profile events.
- 🎙️ Hosted **Google Solution Challenge 2023**, **I/O Extended MENA**, and **Welcome Day ASU FCIS**
- 🧠 Panel Moderator at **DevFest on Campus Delta 2023**
- 🤝 PR Head & Team Leader in student activities, leading successful outreach and logistics
- 📣 Delivered marketing sessions and technical workshops to university students
